# luna-js - SSR framework for WebComponents

## About

luna-js is a framework that makes working with the WebComponents standard a
breeze. It abstracts away a lot of points that makes it more or less
difficult to use WebComponents in your web projects while still being
as close to the platform as possible.

- Routing
- Templating
- Server-side rendering
- Dynamic (client-side) rendering
- CSS-Builds
- Static-site-generation
- Api generation
- Polyfills

luna-js is currently in an early development phase. As such we are continously improving
it. We cannot guarantee that there will be no breaking changes in the future. Use in production
at your own risk.
